<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://staticapp.icpsc.com/icp/loadimage.php/mogile/717941/0a6cc0a6dd4505160fda728bc99f83da/image/jpeg" width="608" height="441" data-cke-saved-src="https://staticapp.icpsc.com/icp/loadimage.php/mogile/717941/0a6cc0a6dd4505160fda728bc99f83da/image/jpeg" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Cobalt prices have nearly <u><strong>TRIPLED</strong></u> in the last year as demand skyrockets!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Bloomberg-chart-1-Nov-29.png" width="561" height="295" data-cke-saved-src="http://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Bloomberg-chart-1-Nov-29.png" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>WHAT IS COBALT?</strong> </span>  Cobalt is a chemical element with symbol Co and atomic number 27. Like nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth&#8217;s crust only in chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron. The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray magnetic metal.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.easycalculation.com/chemistry/elements/images/cobalt.jpg" width="344" height="144" data-cke-saved-src="https://www.easycalculation.com/chemistry/elements/images/cobalt.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: impact;"><span style="font-size: 40px;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">SO WHY COBALT?</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>The battery industry currently uses <strong>42% of Global Cobalt production. </strong></p>
<p>This is because, like Lithium, Cobalt is essential to the supply lines of companies like Tesla, GM, Apple, Nissan, and the plethora of other Electric Vehicles and Tech Gadgets using Lithium-Ion Batteries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surging demand for metals like copper, nickel and cobalt for use in electric vehicles promises to overturn the balance of power between mining companies and their customers&#8221;  according to billionaire investor Robert Friedland.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Nickel sulphate and Cobalt sulphate: these are the sexy commodities that we cannot live with out,&#8221;  </strong>Friedland said.</p>
<p>So with the New iPhones now shipping and Tesla&#8217;s Model 3 experiencing major backorders, Cobalt will be in demand for many decades to come!  And <strong>BRVVF</strong> seems to be benefitting tremendously&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: impact;"><span style="font-size: 40px;"><span style="line-height: 16px;"><strong>BRVVF  &#8211;  THE NEXT BIG COBALT </strong></span></span></span><strong style="font-size: 40px; font-family: impact;">PLAY?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quantum Cobalt Corp. (BRVVF)</strong> is a Vancouver-based resource company with a primary focus on advanced stage gold projects and through Recent Acquisitions: under-explored Cobalt projects within North America.</p>
<p><strong>BRVVF</strong> also happens to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">TRI-LISTED</span> on <u>THREE</u> different foreign stock exchanges &#8211; the US, Canada, as well as three different German exchanges in Dusseldorf, Stuttgart, and Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Not only is this a sign of a solid company but it could also mean increased liquidity and exposure for them.</p>
<p>With multiple Cobalt Mining Projects now under their belt &#8211; <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantum-cobalt-announces-closing-acquisition-060000174.html" data-cke-saved-href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantum-cobalt-announces-closing-acquisition-060000174.html">including a Major Recent Acquisition</a> &#8211; this could still just be the beginning for<strong> BRVVF!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: impact;"><span style="font-size: 40px;"><span style="line-height: 16px;"><strong><br />
BRVVF&#8217;S CHART POISED TO BREAKOUT?</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It should be no surprise that <strong>BRVVF</strong> has been on the rise just as Cobalt prices have seen a Historic Sector <em>BOOM</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And just this month, it <strong>SHATTERED </strong>a Major Chart Resistance Level that has held it back for <u>all of November!</u></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://staticapp.icpsc.com/icp/loadimage.php/mogile/717941/598e76bd83742e8735902ff6065bc29b/image/jpeg" width="624" height="474" data-cke-saved-src="https://staticapp.icpsc.com/icp/loadimage.php/mogile/717941/598e76bd83742e8735902ff6065bc29b/image/jpeg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: impact;"><span style="font-size: 40px;"><span style="line-height: 16px;"><strong> BARCHART RATES <span style="color: #06c406;">&#8220;BUY&#8221;!</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In fact, now both Technical Analysis sites, <a href="https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/BRVVF/opinion" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/BRVVF/opinion">Barchart.com</a> AND <a href="http://www.stockta.com/cgi-bin/analysis.pl?symb=BRVVF&amp;cobrand=&amp;mode=stock" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.stockta.com/cgi-bin/analysis.pl?symb=BRVVF&amp;cobrand=&amp;mode=stock">StockTA.com</a>, currently give <strong>BRVVF</strong> their Top Ratings of <strong>&#8220;STRONG BUY&#8221; </strong>and  <strong>&#8220;VERY BULLISH&#8221; </strong>in the Long Term, respectively!</p>
<p>With 52 Week Highs of 2.29 and a Breakout of major resistance, could <strong>BRVVF</strong> continue it&#8217;s march to new heights?  Read on&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: impact;"><span style="font-size: 50px;"><span style="line-height: 16px;"><strong>BRVVF COBALT PROPERTIES</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>BRVVF</strong> currently has 3 Cobalt Properties, including a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantum-cobalt-announces-closing-acquisition-060000174.html" data-cke-saved-href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantum-cobalt-announces-closing-acquisition-060000174.html">Recently Acquired Property</a> announced last month&#8230;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>THE RABBIT PROPERTY</strong></span></h3>
<p>Last July, the company announced the <strong><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bravura-acquires-cobalt-prospect-near-070500134.html" data-cke-saved-href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bravura-acquires-cobalt-prospect-near-070500134.html">100% Acquisition of a past-producing Cobalt Prospect called &#8220;The Rabbit Property&#8221;</a></strong> near Cobalt, Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>The Rabbit is 1,040 hectre and is comprised of 65 claim units owned by Caprock Ventures with cobalt, gold and nickel mineralization hosted within a fracture zone in diabase approximately 18 inches in width.</p>
<p>A grab sample collected by A.G. Burrows returned an assay of 8.76% Cobalt , and 6.56% Nickel.</p>
<p>Last month, the company&#8217;s Field Crew <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantum-cobalts-field-crew-completes-060000442.html" data-cke-saved-href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantum-cobalts-field-crew-completes-060000442.html">Completed a First Pass Exploration</a> on the project!</p>
<p>Greg Burns , CEO commented<em>  </em><em>&#8220;The Rabbit has great exploration potential as it has strong showings and has yet to be drilled out. With the majority of cobalt coming out of the Democratic Republic of Congo to have a plot of land in a stable political environment with great exploration potential, is a very exciting and something we look to take advantage of.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>THE KAHUNA PROPERTY</strong></span></h3>
<p>This August, the company doubled down on a <strong><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bravura-acquires-2nd-cobalt-prospect-073500242.html" data-cke-saved-href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bravura-acquires-2nd-cobalt-prospect-073500242.html">Second &#8211; EVEN LARGER &#8211; Cobalt Acquisition called the &#8220;Kahuna Property&#8221;</a></strong> &#8211; also near Cobalt, Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>The Kahuna is a 1200 hectre property comprised of 77 claim units with a rich history of cobalt and silver production.</p>
<p>Last month, the company&#8217;s Field Crew <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantum-cobalts-field-crew-completes-060000360.html" data-cke-saved-href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantum-cobalts-field-crew-completes-060000360.html">Completed a First Pass Exploration</a> on the project.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;This transaction increases our land position in an important mining camp and also achieves two objectives. First, we have established a meaningful land position that specifically focuses on rich cobalt deposits. Second, we have improved the overall quality of cobalt showings in our portfolio.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>THE NIPISSING LORRAIN COBALT PROJECT</strong></span></h3>
<p>Just last week, on November 30th, <strong>BRVVF</strong> announced the closing of the <strong><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantum-cobalt-announces-closing-acquisition-060000174.html" data-cke-saved-href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantum-cobalt-announces-closing-acquisition-060000174.html">Newest Aquisition to their Cobalt portfolio &#8211; the Nipissing Lorrain Cobalt Project</a></strong> &#8211; in the South East of Cobalt, Ontario.</p>
<p>The property consists of two separate claims of 464 Hectares and is adjacent to First Cobalt&#8217;s &#8216;Silver Centre&#8217; claims. Six separate underground workings have been historically mined for Cobalt-Silver-Nickel.</p>
<p>Cobalt, silver and nickel mineralization occur on multiple fracture zones and veins within the property.</p>
<p>Greg Burns, CEO commented<em> &#8220;We are pleased to have added the Nipissing Lorrain Cobalt Project to our portfolio. Exploration plans on the Property will be conducted with a heightened level of confidence and commitment recognizing it was a past producer.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: impact;"><span style="font-size: 40px;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">COBALT &#8211; THE NEW &#8220;GOLD RUSH&#8221;?</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">There&#8217;s an old school gold rush underway in northern Ontario with more than a dozen mining companies are staking out claims in Cobalt, Ont. as price of the mineral with the same name rises!<br />
</span><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://uwaterloo.ca/earth-sciences-museum/sites/ca.earth-sciences-museum/files/styles/body-500px-wide/public/uploads/images/Ontario-map-with-Cobalt-500x350.jpg" width="418" height="292" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="http://www.ontarioexplorations101.com/uploads/2/8/1/6/28168073/9072867.jpg" width="412" height="222" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 17px;"><strong>Cobalt is the epicentre of past cobalt mining in Ontario and BRVVF just so happens to be in the midst of it all!</strong></span></p>
<p>&#8220;The whole situation is a cobalt-style rush, just like an old fashioned staking rush,&#8221; said Gino Chitaroni, president of the Northern Prospectors Association and a geologist from the area.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/cobalt-mining-resurgence-1.4030303" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/cobalt-mining-resurgence-1.4030303">&#8220;The deposits are significant</a>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;We&#8217;ll wait and see&#8230;It appears the hunt is on for cobalt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: impact;"><span style="font-size: 40px;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">THE COST OF COBALT &amp; BRVVF&#8217;S ADVANTAGE</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>Cobalt Mining is not without it&#8217;s controversies.</p>
<p>Much of the Cobalt that Apple and many other Tech companies use comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  The Congo supplies 60% of the world&#8217;s cobalt.</p>
<p><a href="http://fortune.com/2017/03/03/apple-cobalt-child-labor/" data-cke-saved-href="http://fortune.com/2017/03/03/apple-cobalt-child-labor/"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://staticapp.icpsc.com/icp/loadimage.php/mogile/717941/77e38431d37b015155f1cf7fc735b60e/image/jpeg" width="524" height="276" data-cke-saved-src="https://staticapp.icpsc.com/icp/loadimage.php/mogile/717941/77e38431d37b015155f1cf7fc735b60e/image/jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>Now I don&#8217;t need to tell you that this region of Africa has historically been a conflict zone for everything from Diamonds to gold, and many other Minerals.</p>
<p>Recently, Apple came under fire when news of <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/03/03/apple-cobalt-child-labor/" data-cke-saved-href="http://fortune.com/2017/03/03/apple-cobalt-child-labor/">Child Labor in hazardous Cobalt Mining Camps in the Congo</a>, owned by its Chinese supplier, surfaced.</p>
<p>Apple has since stated it will no longer source confict cobalt and has sought supplier changes while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/01/no-cobalt-no-tesla/" data-cke-saved-href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/01/no-cobalt-no-tesla/">Tesla has stated it will now exclusively source cobalt from North America</a>.</p>
<p>All of may bode extremely well for <strong>BRVVF</strong> &#8211; a North American producer &#8211; as it gives them a huge advantage to supply Cobalt from the conflict-free Canada!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><span style="font-size: 17px;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">JUST IMAGINE IF BRVVF BECAME AN EXCLUSIVE SUPPLIER TO APPLE OR TESLA! </span></span></strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: impact;"><span style="font-size: 45px;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">BRVVF INSIDERS ARE GOBBLING UP SHARES!</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.canadianinsider.com/company?menu_tickersearch=QBOT%20%7C%20Quantum%20Cobalt" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.canadianinsider.com/company?menu_tickersearch=QBOT%20%7C%20Quantum%20Cobalt">CanadianInsider.com</a>, 32,500 Shares were purchased @ around 1.80 CAD by Quantum Cobalt Corp&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=267664381&amp;privcapId=129339195" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=267664381&amp;privcapId=129339195">CFO/Director, Kenneth Tollstam</a>, in December!</p>
<p><strong>THAT&#8217;S AROUND $58,500. CAD or $45,500 USD  &#8212;  <u>literally the price of a New Car</u>!!!</strong></p>
<p>Then on December 8th, Director &amp; Board Member, Von Torres purchased another 32,000 shares at around $1.68!</p>
<p><strong>THAT&#8217;S AROUND $53,760. CAD or $41,800 USD!<br />
</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 17px;"><strong>COULD SOMETHING BIG BE ON THE HORIZON?</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: impact; color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-size: 50px;"><span style="line-height: 16px;"><strong><u>THE BOTTOM LINE</u></strong></span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 20px;">With last month&#8217;s Major Acquisition News now giving <strong>BRVVF</strong> *THREE* potentially lucrative Cobalt properties in their portfolio + Cobalt prices on a Historic rise, could this just be the start of things to come?</span></p>
